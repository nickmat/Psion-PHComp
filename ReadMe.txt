PHCOMP is a utility to assist in writing the help text in the format
required by a *.rss resource file. The text can be written in free form and
fully justified as a normal text file. The utility then produces a file that
can be compiled by the Psion Resource Compiler.

There is no charge for using this software. It may be freely distributed
with only one restriction, all the files listed below (which includes this
one) must be included and must be unmodified.

Any comments, good or bad, should be addressed to me (Nick Matthews),
preferably by email. I am always pleased to hear from anyone using ly
software.
