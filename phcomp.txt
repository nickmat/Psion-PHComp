Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Psion Help Compiler (phcomp.exe) is designed to simplify writing Psion
  help resouce files, particularly when modifing them. Text can be modified
  and rejustified using a standard text editor. Include files can be used to
  create files that contain just one help page of text.
  
  The output of the compiler is a file that can be included in the project
  .rss file for further compilation by the Psion Resource Compiler.

Usage
~~~~~

  PHCOMP filename[.RHT] [-Ofilename[.RHI]] [-Ipath] [-L] [-S] [-V]

  filename  Input File Name. The default extenrion is .RHT
  -O  Output filename. The default is the input filename.
      The default extension is .RHI.
  -I  Path(s) to be searched for Include files
  -L  Left trim whitespace from text.
  -S  Silent, suppress startup banner.
  -V  Verbose, outputs compiler progress to stdout.

     Case or order for command line switches is not significant
     and either "-" or "/" may be used.

Input File Spec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The input file uses 5 keyword: #Page, #Topic, #Include, #End and # by
  itself. The keywords must be at the start of a new line.

  The help text is placed between the #Page and either the next #Page or
  #End keywords. The #Topic keyword, if required, must follow the #Page
  keyword and come before the help text. An #End keyword must appear after
  the final #Page. Any text outside a #Page/#End block is ignored. Any line
  starting with # and followed by whitespace is also ignored.
  
  The #Include keyword may be placed anywhere in the file and may be nested.
 
  Bl`nk lines before and after the help text is ignored, while multiple
  blank lines within the text are reduced to one.
  
  The case of the keywords is not significant.
  
  #Page identifier title
  
     Everything following the identifer is included in the title.
     
  #Topic identifer
  
     If used, this must appear after #Page and before the help text, if any.
     Note that a TOPIC_ARRAY identifer is created by appending __i to the
     page identifier.

  #Include filename
  
     Optional. There is no default extension. Filename does not require
     quotes.
          
  #End
  
     This may be placed at the end of any page but must be used after the
     last one.
     
  # Any comments can go here
  
     Comment lines are ignored.
